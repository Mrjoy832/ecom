## What is compliance and how it is different from security in e-commerce 
Compliance and security are two distinct but closely related concepts in the context of e-commerce.
Compliance refers to adhering to specific rules, regulations, standards, or guidelines set by governing bodies or industry organizations. These rules are typically designed to ensure the protection of sensitive data, privacy, and consumer rights. Compliance requirements may vary depending on the country, industry, or specific regulations applicable to e-commerce operations.
In e-commerce, compliance often involves meeting standards such as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), or other regional or industry-specific regulations. Compliance typically encompasses areas like data protection, privacy, information security, financial transactions, and consumer rights.
Security, on the other hand, is focused on protecting the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of information and resources within an e-commerce system. It involves implementing measures and practices to safeguard data, prevent unauthorized access, protect against cyber threats, and ensure the overall security of the e-commerce infrastructure.
E-commerce security measures may include encryption, secure socket layer (SSL) certificates for secure connections, firewalls, intrusion detection systems, secure coding practices, regular system audits, and employee training on security best practices. The objective is to protect against various security risks, such as data breaches, fraud, identity theft, and other malicious activities.
While compliance and security are distinct concepts, they are closely related. Achieving compliance often requires implementing security measures as part of the overall strategy to protect sensitive data and ensure regulatory compliance. Compliance can be seen as a set of requirements, while security is the means to achieve those requirements and protect the e-commerce system from potential threats and vulnerabilities
